## Introduction

This guide is designed to introduce to Docker, a platform that encapsulates applications into lightweight, portable containers.

## Getting Started with Docker

### Setting Up Docker

Install Docker on your system by following the official installation guide for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

In Windows, mounting data and images into a Docker container can be achieved through Bind Mounts. This approach allows you to map a directory on your host machine directly into your container, enabling live data exchange between the host and the container. While similar in outcome, the process differs slightly from Linux due to the Hyper-V restrictions. For more detailed explanations and additional code examples, please refer to the full tutorial in the accompanying PDF document.
